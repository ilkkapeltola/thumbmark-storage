# ThumbmarkStore

ThumbmarkStore uses the browser fingerprinting library [ThumbmarkJS](https://github.com/ilkkapeltola/thumbmarkjs) to implement a handy store that behaves in a similar way as `localStore`.

For now it implements `getItem(key)` and `putItem(key, value)` functions. Both key and value must be strings.
